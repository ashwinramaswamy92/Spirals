Good morning,

I’m Shelby, a graduate student researching how the “critical race theory” debate began and has been covered by the media.

I read The Role and Impact of Fox News, which cited the Reinforcing Spirals Model. The author specifically mentions the role a perceived threat plays in media consumption.

In short, our findings show that Fox News was the first major cable network to begin talking about “critical race theory” and has covered it much more than CNN and MSNBC. They started discussing it on their opinion programs well before there were any presidential orders or parent-led protests. The phrases associated with CRT are that it’s “running rampant,” “spreading like wildfire,” and that “woke indoctrination is taking over our schools.” The threat is imminent. As I review posts of concerned parents in Stop Critical Race Theory Facebook Groups, it is clear that they truly believe critical race theory is pervasive and an immediate threat to their children’s well being.

Would you be able to contextualize what is happening here? If you cannot speak specifically to Fox’s coverage of CRT, I would welcome any general explanation for how threats circulate in the media and whether there have been instances in which the media has practically created a perceived threat.

Thank you in advance for considering my request
