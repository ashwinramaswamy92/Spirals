I spotted reversed order in data on Steps 2&3, now is the order correct, so Step 3 sometimes produces higher polarization than Step 2.  
  
  

# Introduction  

Now let us read data in! 


```{r message=FALSE}
# Clearing all
rm(list=ls())

# Packages:
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)
library(forcats)
library(ggplot2)
library(rstatix)
library(stringr)
library(knitr)
# library(kableExtra)
library(stargazer)
library(caTools)
library(ROCR)


#### Reading data in:
# source("SOM_loading.R")
load("SOM.RData")

```



# Step 1 VS. Step 2  

Firstly, data filtering:   

```{r step 1 vs 2}
df = tc %>% filter((Step == "No Identity, Constant Boundary" | Step == "No Identity, Normal Boundary"), 
                   Boundary_STD == 0, Conformity_STD == 0, HK_distribution == "FALSE")
df %>% count(Step)

```

Computing sim-by-sim difference:

```{r}

  rename("S1" = 14, "S2" = 15) %>% 
  mutate(
    Difference = S2 - S1,
    highDifference = abs(Difference) > 0.1) %>% 
  # Then we compute difference:
  # summarise(across(diversity:ESBG, ~sd(.x) / sqrt(2), .names = "{.col}_sd")) %>% ungroup() %>% 
  # And now, also pivoting data for the future graph:

## Comparison of models estimated on full/reduced data:
stargazer(ml, mdl, type = "text", title = "Comparison of models estimated on full/reduced data")

## Calculating moddel precision:

splited$Prediction = NA
splited[splited$Test,]$Prediction = prd

## Quality of prediction of non/extreme
