I spotted reversed order in data on Steps 2&3, now is the order correct, so Step 3 sometimes produces higher polarization than Step 2.  
  
  

# Introduction  

Now let us read data in! 


```{r message=FALSE}
# Clearing all
rm(list=ls())

# Packages:
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)
library(forcats)
library(ggplot2)
library(rstatix)
library(stringr)
library(knitr)
# library(kableExtra)
library(stargazer)
library(caTools)
library(ROCR)


#### Reading data in:
# source("SOM_loading.R")
load("SOM.RData")

```



# Step 1 VS. Step 2  

Firstly, data filtering:   

```{r step 1 vs 2}
df = tc %>% filter((Step == "No Identity, Constant Boundary" | Step == "No Identity, Normal Boundary"), 
                   Boundary_STD == 0, Conformity_STD == 0, HK_distribution == "FALSE")
df %>% count(Step)

```

Comparison:   

Computing sim-by-sim difference:

```{r}
# We split data into pairs according all relevant varibles, except STEP:
dp = df %>%  
  pivot_longer(cols = diversity:ESBG) %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(HK_distribution:Conformity_STD, name), names_from = Step, values_from = value) %>% 
  rename("S1" = 14, "S2" = 15) %>% 
  mutate(
    Difference = S2 - S1,
    highDifference = abs(Difference) > 0.1) %>% 
  mutate(across(N:name, ~factor(.x)))

# We split data into groups according all relevant varibles, except STEP:
dg = dp %>% group_by(N, Boundary, Conformity, name) %>% 
  summarise(Difference_sd = sd(Difference)) %>% 
  mutate(highDifference = Difference_sd > 0.1)

  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c( 0.1)) +

  theme_light()

mp = lm(Difference ~ name+Conformity+Boundary+N, data = dp)
mpa = lm(abs(Difference) ~ name+Conformity+Boundary+N, data = dp)
mg = lm(Difference_sd ~ name+Conformity+Boundary+N, data = dg)
stargazer(mp, mpa, mg, type = "text")

```


## Tables with extremes  


```{r}

  kable(caption = "Table with fraction of extreme absolute differences in pairs comparison")

dg %>% group_by(name) %>% summarise(fractionOfHighDifferences = mean(highDifference)) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Table with fraction of extreme SD of within-groups comparison")

```


 

# Step 2 VS. Step 3  

Firstly, data filtering:   

```{r step 3 vs 2}
df = tc %>% filter((Step == "Constant SPIRO, Normal Boundary" | Step == "No Identity, Normal Boundary"), SPIRO_Mean == 0.25)
df %>% count(Step)

```

## Quality of prediction of non/extreme
