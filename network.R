# Reading in and storing data from experiment -----------------------------------------

# Since data-files are still huge, we have to combine separately data with POPULATIONS 513, 257, 129,
# so we firstly need cycle iterating over ´Population´:
for (k in c(129, 257, 513)) {

  # Since data are long we have to do them seed by seed.
  # So we need secondly the cycle iterating over seeds:
  for (j in 1:10) {

    # We take a vector with filenames of all simulation results from directory 'Sims':
    d = dir(path = "Sims", pattern = paste0("Sims02_", j,"_", k, "_*"))

    # We read the first file and transform it accordingly for the storing in master datafile:
    df = read_csv(paste0("Sims/", d[37])) %>%  # NOTE: 37 is important -- we have to find the first simulation with 2 dimensions of opinion space to more smoothly add cases of data-files from other simulations
      select(-starts_with("Nei")) %>%  # NOTE: without comp. cluster or better code or data storing politics we can't read in also the network data, files are then too huge and personal computer is not able to red, add and store updated dataframes, so for now, we have to information on networks cut out. Now the option is to agree on what we need to prapare from the network data, prepare it and store by each agent or by each simulation.
      mutate(Meta = d[37]) %>%  # We store file name as variable, since the name contains all meta data
